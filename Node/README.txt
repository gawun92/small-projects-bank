This is Node written by C++
The node struct is defined in private.
There are global functions: size, insert, erase, contains, get, and swaps.
These functions are all related to node.

Also, with two nodes, they can be dealt with by two functions : unite and subtract.
ex)   SET_A = {1,2,3}          SET_B = {2,3,4}
unite    --> {1,2,3,4}
subtract --> {1}
